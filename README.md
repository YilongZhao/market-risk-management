Market Risk Analysis and Regulatory Capital, NYU Tandon 12/2016

• Used regression and financial models (e.g. Black-Scholes model) to estimate sensitivity (e.g., beta, key rate duration and Greeks) to key risk factors for a portfolio of selected stocks, bonds, derivatives and commodity and then calculated analytical VaR

• Used risk adjusted return metrics (e.g. reward-to-VaR) to compare proposed candidate portfolios and propose the best allocation

• Conducted trend analysis on key macroeconomic factors to build stress scenarios and performed stress testing on the selected portfolio with self-built scenarios and CCAR scenarios

• Calculated the portfolio RWA and regulatory capital for the proposed portfolio based on Basel I and Basel II.5 requirements
